<p>I was always interested in computers, and coding. I always wanted to make my website. After graduating from secondary school, I realized that just going to school won't make me
a good coder. Because of that, I decided to start going to coding courses. blah blah blah. I wish lorem thing on vscode was working in markdown too. Anyways, since this is an example,
I won't take it too long. But you can do that in your website.</p>
