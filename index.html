    <p>Hello! My name is John Doe. I'm a 100% real person with that 144p face you see on the favicon, and I'm totally not a placeholder person for this example website! Speaking of, this website is just an example for websites you can generate using <a href="https://github.com/efekos">efekos</a><a href="https://github.com/efekos/PortfolioGenerator">/PortfolioGenerator</a>. It helped me a lot making this website, hope it helps you too! Anyway, let's get to me. Despite having experience with marketing a lot, my main job is Full-Stack developing websites. I didn't make a website for me though. Why waste your time when <a href="https://github.com/efekos">efekos</a><a href="https://github.com/efekos/PortfolioGenerator">/PortfolioGenerator</a> exists, right? I'm just kidding, you get the deal. This is an example website. Now go check the other stuff.</p>
