# Contributing to Portfolio Generator

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to PortfolioGenerator! I appreciate any kind of contribution you'll
make to this project, and I hope this project gets better with your contribution.

## Ways of contributing

### Translating

Websites generated with Portfolio Generator has a localization system. If you would like to help us, consider the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/p-gen)
page! After you log in to Crowdin with an account, you can easily start translating. When at least 50% of the translation
in a language is approved, that language will be added to the project, along with everyone who contributed to the translation
for that language.

### Coding

When contributing to the project via code, make sure to follow these instructions:

* **Use Forks & Branches** - Always create a fork and a sub-branch for your work. Each branch can be for a single feature, such as "translation" or "advanced-project-system".
* **Use Loggers** - Never forget to use the logger while doing something, always log what you did, log warnings when there is a mistake made by the user, and always log everything you do to the debug logger.
